This is a game being developed for my Independent Study in Integrated Digital Media. This game is being developed in C++ using SDL. This game is to familiarize myself with Game Development concepts. All assets used in this game are not owned by me and are being used to learn how to program the game specifically. A future endeavor would be to use custom assets but the main objective is to learn to create a rudimentary game in C++, a common language to implement games in.

This project features:
-creating an SDL window
-having it listen for keyboard and mouse input
-drawing and rendering images to screen
-creating a character
-animating the character
-having the character move based on different keyboard inputs
-drawing tiles to the screen
-creating a map for the character to live in
-screen scrolling so the view follows the character as he moves through the map
-very basic collision detection to keep the player within the boundaries of the map
-opening an audio channel to play an mp3 file
