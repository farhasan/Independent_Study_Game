This is a game being developed for my Independent Study in Integrated Digital Media. This game is being developed in C++ using SDL. This game is to familiarize myself with Game Development concepts. All assets used in this game are not owned by me and are being used to learn how to program the game specifically. A future endeavor would be to use custom assets but the main objective is to learn to create a function game in C++, a common language to implement games in.
